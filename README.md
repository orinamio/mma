## Hidden feature (probably should be more visible) ðŸ˜‰
- On long press avatar, it navigates to the profile page


## What isn't implement or not implemented to my satisfaction
- on scroll avatar profile list, ensure the profile info scrollview is scrolling exactly like the requirement.
- last item in profile info scrollview isn't starting from the correct postion in view
